Basic steps:

1) Use Google Fusion Tables to create your point and polygon map layers, and change the feature styles (set ranges, colors, etc.) and info windows.

2) Make your own copy of this template: either Fork to your own GitHub account, or Clone in Desktop, or Download a ZIP compressed version to your desktop.

3) Modify two files, following instructions in the code comments, to match your Google Fusion Table data:

- index.html
- maps_lib.js (located inside the js folder)

3) Host everything on the web (such as a GitHub repository gh-pages branch)

## TO DO
- add iframe version
- update to Derek Eder's template v1.4
